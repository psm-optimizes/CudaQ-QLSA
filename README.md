# CudaQ-QLSA
Implementation of different quantum linear system solvers using CudaQ

The notebook QLSS.ipynb is an implementation of the HHL algorithm for solving a 4 by 4 linear system. 

The quantum circuit is proposed by Cao et. al. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.2232v2.pdf

Note: Quantum tomography is yet to be applied to this circuit.
